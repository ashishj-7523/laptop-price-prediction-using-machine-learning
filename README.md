# Laptop Price Predictor

Welcome to the Laptop Price Predictor project! ðŸš€

## Overview

This machine learning project focuses on predicting laptop prices based on various features. We've extracted data from multiple platforms, performed extensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The project includes data preprocessing, scaling, feature selection, and model training using four different algorithms.

## Models and Metrics

We trained models using the following algorithms:

1. **Linear Regression**
   - MAE: 0.210178
   - RMSE: 0.271490
   - R-squared: 0.807328

2. **Decision Tree**
   - MAE: 0.194124
   - RMSE: 0.266029
   - R-squared: 0.815001

3. **Random Forest**
   - MAE: 0.156390
   - RMSE: 0.208922
   - R-squared: 0.885902

4. **Gradient Boosting**
   - MAE: 0.175152
   - RMSE: 0.224905
   - R-squared: 0.867776

The **best model** identified is **Random Forest** with superior metrics.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

To further enhance the Random Forest model, we performed hyperparameter tuning using grid search. This optimization process aimed to find the best hyperparameters for improved performance.
